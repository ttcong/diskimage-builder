    # to "/var/lib/rpm" (note, this is taken relative to the
    # --installroot).

    # Also note, we only want this done around this call -- this is
    # the only place we are using yum outside the chroot, and hence
    # picking up the base-system's default rpm macros.  For example,
    # the yumdownloader calls above in _install_repos want to use
    # ~/.rpmdb/ ... there is nothing in the build-system /var/lib/rpm!
    #
    # Another issue we hit is having to set --releasedir here.  yum
    # determines $releasevar based on (more or less) "rpm -q
    # --whatprovides $distroverpkg".  By default, this is
    # "redhat-release" (fedora-release provides redhat-release) but
    # some platforms like CentOS override it in /etc/yum.conf (to
    # centos-release in their case).  You can't override this (see
    # [1]), but setting --releasever works around this.
