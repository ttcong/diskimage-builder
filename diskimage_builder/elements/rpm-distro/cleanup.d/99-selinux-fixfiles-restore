#   Not all of the contexts defined by the offline system's
#   file_contexts may be valid under the policy of the host on which
#   you are running (e.g.  if they run different distributions or even
#   different releases of the same distribution), which will normally
#   prevent setting those contexts (the kernel won't recognize them).
#   If you have this issue, you'll need to run setfiles as root in a
#   special domain, setfiles_mac_t, that is allowed to set contexts
#   unknown to the host policy, and likely chrooted so that it doesn't
#   ask the kernel whether the contexts are valid via
#   /sys/fs/selinux/context.  That is how livecd-creator supported
#   creating images for other releases.

# One issue you might see without fixing selinux file labels is sshd
# will run in the kernel_t domain instead of the sshd_t domain, making
# ssh connections fail with "Unable to get valid context for <user>"
# error message.  Other failures will occur too.

# XXX: is it really valid to build rpm-distros without this?
